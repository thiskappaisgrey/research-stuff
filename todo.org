** TODO http://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.S983/recs/formal_recitation/#verifying-the-tiny-cpu - try to follow along with this tutorial
** TODO Try to create a simple CPU pipeline and formally verify each part (or just fake it)
** TODO Try to figure out how to use egglog (or something similar) to synthesize based on verified results.
*** use results of each part as an "input" to the egglog synthesis program
** DONE Add racket to the nix flake

* idea scratch
- think of synthesis as a nix-derivation
- essentially - you have a "target" with some dependencies
- compile/cache certain dependencies along the way - tries to make things faster..?
